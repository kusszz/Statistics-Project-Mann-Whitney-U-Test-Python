# Statistics-Project-Mann-Whitney-U-Test-Python

This is procject was made by me for statiscics classes. 

It analyzes whether physical activity and general well-being are linked, using survey data from 60 Gdańsk residents of various ages. I'm using the Mann-Whitney U test to compare: whether exercise has no effect on well-being (H0​) or if it actually makes a difference (H1​). Essentially, I want to see if being active leads to feeling better.

The data for this project has been shortened for sharing, but it still represents the original results.
